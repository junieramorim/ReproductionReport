%%Suggestion: create a session METHOD and put the 4 following sections inside it as subsection - explain the reproduction with results similar to the original experiment. It will be used as base to compare the replications results

To obtain empirical evidence on whether the original algorithms work in a dynamic scenario and to propose their eventual improvement to better address dynamism, this work relies on action research (AR)~\cite{action_research}. Based on this method, the research followed an iterative process comprising experiment replications and algorithms extension considering dynamic scenarios. This section first addresses the fundamental requirement of reproducibility of the original study (Section \ref{sec:reproducibility}). Next, the dynamic scenario common to both replications is described, and finally a description of the  extended algorithms is presented. 
%The replications are described in detail in Section \ref{sec:replications}.
