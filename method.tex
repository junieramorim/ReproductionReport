%%Suggestion: create a session METHOD and put the 4 following sections inside it as subsection - explain the reproduction with results similar to the original experiment. It will be used as base to compare the replications results

To obtain empirical evidence on whether the original algorithms work in a dynamic context and to propose their eventual improvement to better address dynamism, this work relies on action research (AR)\cite{action_research}. Based on this research method, our research followed an interactive process comprising experiment replications and algorithms extension in a dynamic scenario. In this section, we first address the fundamental requirement of reproducibility of the original study (Section \ref{sec:reproducibility}). Next,  we describe the dynamic scenario common to both replications, and finally describe the extended algorithms. The replications are described in detail in Section \ref{sec:replications}.
