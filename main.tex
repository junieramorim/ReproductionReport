\begin{abstract}

Many previous works proposed the usage of swarm intelligence as a strategy to solve the allocation task problem. This approach is specially appropriate when there is a set of agents in a collaborative and decentralized job. One model applied to this problem is the generalized allocation problem(GAP). The reference study to this work proposed a new method based on three variation of the heuristic swarm-GAP in order to overcome its limitations and make a better usage of the agents available. However it only considers a static scenario, where there are no attributes changes during system execution. As the original domain of the problem is the usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (\uavs) as agents to perform a set of tasks, it is a primary requirement of systems in that context to support an expected high level of dynamism. Some attributes can change in runtime, e.g. number of agents or mission, and it can impact on the results obtained. This study presents an extension of the original work through a dynamism insertion in the original algorithm during an independent replication of the original experiments. There are some evidences that strategies with good quality responses in a static scenario is not capable to maintain a good level of quality in dynamic contexts even with small attribute changes.
