This section aims to identify the main aspects found during the replications done and to analyze all results obtained (see Section \ref{sec:findings}), identifying its implications for practice (see Section \ref{sec:implications}), characterizing the threats to the study validity (see Section \ref{sec:threats}), listing the main existing limitations in this work and the opportunities to perform future works from this one (see Section \ref{sec:limitations}).
