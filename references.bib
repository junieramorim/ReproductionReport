	Abstract = {Today software is the main enabler of many of the appliances and devices omnipresent in our daily life and important for our well being and work satisfaction. It is expected that the software works as intended, and that the software always and everywhere provides us with the best possible utility. This paper discusses the motivation, technical approach, and innovative results of the MUSIC project. MUSIC provides a comprehensive software development framework for applications that operate in ubiquitous and dynamic computing environments and adapt to context changes. Context is understood as any information about the user needs and operating environment which vary dynamically and have an impact on design choices. MUSIC supports several adaptation mechanisms and offers a model-driven application development approach supported by a sophisticated middleware that facilitates the dynamic and automatic adaptation of applications and services based on a clear separation of business logic, context awareness and adaptation concerns. The main contribution of this paper is a holistic, coherent presentation of the motivation, design, implementation, and evaluation of the MUSIC development framework and methodology.},

Furthermore, we focus on adaptation that is required to ensure continuous satisfaction of non-functional requirements. We propose that the implementation should be architected as a dynamic software product line (DSPL), whose target configurations can be generated dynamically. We discuss how the DSPL can be verified against non-functional requirements at design time through model checking. We also discuss how at run time the appropriate instance of the DSPL can be selected and dynamically installed and enacted as context changes are detected that can be handled correctly by such instance.},

Managing dynamic variations demands is a challenge addressed by DSPL paradigm. In this context, this paper introduces the results of a systematic literature review that involved 2,084 studies, with the objective of understanding how the dynamic derivation in DSPL is made. The contributions of this study are: a) an embracing analysis and classification of scientific literature in DSPL area, b) the definition of inputs that are needed to perform the dynamic derivation, c) the description of what composes these inputs, and d) the understanding of the process to perform the dynamic derivation. We conclude that due to the lack of maturity in the dynamic derivation field, there are many open research opportunities still available.},

	Annote = {Possible combinations in the SPL is not feasible. (exponential)

SPL: set of softwares that uses a common code base (common artifact)

Feature: user visible behavior, aspect, characteristic or quality of a sofwtare system

SPL used in critical systems to ensure quality (avionics, automotive and medical systems) [Weiss 2008]

Software analysis (type checking, static analysis, model checking and theorem proving) needs to be applied to SPL

The common base of a SPL conducts to similarity between the products generated. The analysis of all product could require redundant computations.

Product-line analyses: uses different strategies to make them aware of the variability and the features of SPL products

It tries to empower develops to assess and predict analysis effort based on static characteristics of a SPL

Goals of this work:
(a) making research more systematic and efficient, 
(b) enabling tool developers to create new tools based on existing research results and combine them on demand for more powerful analyses, and 
(c) empowering product-line developers to choose the right analysis technique for their needs out of a pool of techniques with different strengths and weaknesses.

The focus was products generated automatically based on a feature selection


SPL examples: build scripts with conditional compilations (ifdef) - Linux Kernel
annotation-based and composition-based

The article uses a running example (with 3 features)

AHEAD tool suite [Batory et al. 2004] => compose the features selected to generate the final product

Feature Diagram => is a graphical representation of a VARIABILITY MODEL defining a hierarchy between features [Kang et al. 1990]

abstract features => are used only to group other features

A feature implementation may rely on the implementation of another one

Type checking: syntactic method for proving the absence of ceratin program behavior classifying according to the kinds of values

(Type errors detector)



===> Model checking: verifies if the formal model satisfies its specification


====>Theorem proving => processing logical formulas by applying inference rules


Product Line specification:
-> Domain-Independent Specification: use of a particular product-line implementation technique or programming language
-> Family-Wide specification: define a specification for a particular product line
-> Product-Based Specification
-> Feature-Based Specification: specifies behavior of features instead of products
-> Family-Based Specification


====
This work tries to classify the existing product lines analyses based on the necessary effort (analysis strategy) => product-based, feature-based and family-based analyses
- It was applied a survey


Product-Based  analyses: classical software analysis can be used to analyze each product. Separated analysis is inefficient

Sample-Based Analyses => the analysis of a product is covered by the analysis of the other product

Works on the domains artifacts (such as feature modules) can be more efficient (Family-based analyses)

Feature Based Analysis: works on Domain artifacts and consider the features isolated (do not affect each other) => And the features interaction? (disadvantage)

We can combine techniques. (i.s. Feature-Product_Based Analyses)

The major number of articles is Family-Based Analysis followed by Feature-Product_based and Product-Based Analysis
The major difference is: what redundant computation is avoided

	Abstract = {Agility is the capability to successfully effect, cope with, and/or exploit changes in circumstances. While other factors will also influence outcomes, C2 Agility enables entities to effectively and efficiently employ the resources they have in a timely manner in a variety of missions and circumstances. SAS-085 was formed to improve the understanding of C2 Agility and assess its importance to NATO. SAS-085 accomplished these objectives by articulating the principles of C2 Agility, in the form of a C2 Agility Conceptual Model, substantially validating this model and establishing the importance of improving C2 Agility with empirical evidence obtained from a set of retrospective case studies and simulation-based experiments. Further, it identified next steps toward practical implementation in NATO operations and priorities for increasing the rigor and practicality of methods for measuring and improving C2 Agility.},

	Annote = {- extreme uncertainty
- public exposion (Media)

- support to multi-agency disaster relief compatibility (Coordination)

- C2 dimensions: 
		1) Allocation of Decision Rights (ADR) => how is the distribution of responsibilities and decision power
		2) Patterns of Interaction (PoL) = interactions among the elements
		3) Distribution of Information (DoI)

Mission/circumstances change will locate the C2 Approach in a different portion of the Endeavour Space
===> Keep effective (ability to manoeuvre in the C2 Approach Space)

=> FLEXIBILITY (more than one choice) and RESPONSIVENESS (capacity to change a response when the circumstance changes getting a corrective action)


=> More networked structure is not a guarantee of better choice in all situations
=> Network Enabled Capability (NEC) => transition phase to improve responses on real situations (more complex)


=> 4 levels NATO NEC capabilities :
				* Deconflicting
				* Coordinating
				* Collaborating
				* Coherence

Five C2 maturity levels

The tenet of co-evolution puts a diagonal relating the three axes. Depending on the circumstances, it is necessary to move along one or twot of these dimensions


=> Higher maturity level is capable to operate in any portion of C2 Approach Space
=> In sme circumstances, it is better to operate not in the Edge of the C2 Approach Space

=> C2 Approach with automatic systems is a challenge
Agility = outcome + capability

Agility is the capability to successfully effect, cope with and/or exploit changes in circumstances

It needs to cope with the circumstances changes

The circumstances changes are: changes to the state of the other Entities, changes to the environment or changes to the self state
Effect= being proactive

Agility enablers: Responsiveness, Versatility, Flexibility, Resilience, Innovativeness and  Adaptability 
* They are not independent of one another

==> For a specific level of flexibility, a higher resilience gives  a higher agility level

Agility chain: the last level is the characteristics and capabilities of INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS, PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS

How to measure agility? Or lack of agility?
- degree of effectiveness that an Entity manifests in a particular situation
- Potential of an Entity in an Endeavour Space


ENDEAVOUR SPACE: set of possible test cases (not the cases themselves). Thus, the possible changes in different circumstances can be thought .(identify variables that are relevant to the prediction)
   * changes to entity
   * changes to mission/environment
Entity occupies different portions of the Endeavour space depending on the circumstaces (dynamic environment)
when an entity occupies more space, more agile it is.
There are problems with ES approach (the definition of the ES is a problem)

There is an evidence that there is no ``one size fits all'' approach to C2

An entity can improve C2 Agility by either improving the agility of one or more of the C2 Approaches it can adopt (C2 Approach Agility), by adding additional C2 Approaches to its toolkit, or by improving its ability to appropriately move among various C2 approaches


======>>>> C2 Agility is an Entity's capability to successfully accomplish C2 functions over the entire Endeavour Space.

===> C2 Agility is a function of C2 Approach Agility and C2 Maneuver Agility   


Initially, the appropriate C2 Approach is the same as the actual C2 Approach that results in acceptable performance. After the first change of circumstances, a more network-enabled approach (these approaches are color-coded to the NATO NEC C2 Maturity Model) is now required but the transition to the appropriate approach takes some time. This results in a time period where performance is not acceptable. A second change in circumstances occurs, again requiring a more networked-enabled approach, but this time the transition is immediate without any period of unacceptable performance. A third change in circumstances does not change the C2 Approach that is appropriate but impacts the ability of the Entity to maintain the appropriate C2 Approach. As a result, C2 performance becomes unacceptable. A fourth change of circumstances results in a less networked--enabled C2 Approach being appropriate. While the actual C2 Approach is not immediately changed, the Actual C2 Approach is now acceptable (meets mission requirements although is not the most efficient choice). Finally, the C2 Approach is adjusted and although still not the most efficient choice, C2 efficiency is improved.


Self awareness -> the entity knows its own situation to a correct suitability of C2 Approach


12 Hypothesis were drawed to be validated throught case studies and/or Experiments


Methods: Meta-ANalysis, Experimentation (e.g. PANOPEA - Italy, ELICIT - USA, IMAGE Canada)

Dependent Variables : Last Position of a Collective in the C2 Approach Space (values to each axis of the C2 cube)

	Abstract = {Among empirical software engineering studies, those based on data retrieved from development repositories (such as those of source code management, issue tracking or communication systems) are specially suitable for reproduction. However their reproducibility status can vary a lot, from easy to almost impossible to reproduce. This paper explores which elements can be considered to characterize the reproducibility of a study in this area, and how they can be analyzed to better understand the type of reproduction studies they enable or obstruct. One of the main results of this exploration is the need of a systematic approach to asses the reproducibility of a study, due to the complexity of the processes usually involved, and the many details to be taken into account. To address this need, a methodology for assessing the reproducibility of studies is also presented and discussed, as a tool to help to raise awareness about research reproducibility in this field. The application of the methodology in practice has shown how, even for papers aimed to be reproducible, a systematic analysis raises important aspects that render reproduction difficult or impossible. We also show how, by identifying elements and attributes related to reproducibility, it can be better understood which kind of reproduction can be done for a specific study, given the description of datasets, methodologies and parameters it uses.},

In this paper,
we take a restricted view of reproducible research (RR)
defining it as the extent to which the report of a specific
scientific study can be reproduced (in effect,
compiled) from the reported text, data and analysis
procedures, and thus validated by other researchers.
Although we emphasise that reproducibility and
replication are different things, it is also the case that
research incorporating reproducibility is likely to be
easier to replicate than research that does not.

<<very nice synthesis of the key idea of the paper. Our DSM approach complies with it. We probably also take a deeper generative view by automating execution and part of the analysis from the experiment specification.

=> Usamos simula{\c c}{\~o}es devido aos aspectos de custos, tempo, riscos envolvidos (Ex.: permiss{\~a}o para v{\^o}o)

=> Aloca{\c c}{\~a}o de tarefas em times de drones com autonomia de execu{\c c}{\~a}o. As tarefas (miss{\~a}o) s{\~a}o enviadas por um comando central

=> This problem can be handled as a task allocation among agents, in which the UAVs are the agents and the mission is associated with a set of tasks 

=> Swarm GAP n{\~a}o {\'e} aplic{\'a}vel no caso de comando centralizado pois pode conduzir ao uso indevido dos recursos (drones idle)

=> Therefore, the contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new method with three algorithm variants, which aim to: (i) allow the agents use their resources to perform as many tasks as possible; (ii) avoid the agents assigning their resources to tasks that are not very suitable for them; and (iii) allow an efficient workload balance among the agents, that is, to prevent some agents from being overloaded with tasks while others remain idle. 


1) SWARM-GAP: O token pode circular e na primeira vez a tarefa n{\~a}o ser alocada, mas na segunda ser. Isso {\'e} dado a capacidade (k) e a Tend{\^e}ncia (T). A escolha da tarefa {\'e} baseada apenas nas informa{\c c}{\~o}es locais. N{\~a}o {\'e} determin{\'\i}stico a escolha das tarefas. (pouca ou nenhuma comunica{\c c}{\~a}o entre drones)

2) AL: Recircula o token de modo a dar chance para tarefas n{\~a}o alocadas serem selecionadas, entretanto limpa a lista de drones visitados mantendo o restante das informa{\c c}{\~o}es (melhoria do SWARM-GAP). O token pode circular indefinidamente com tarefas n{\~a}o alocadas pois n{\~a}o h{\'a} recursos dispon{\'\i}veis no drone.

3) SAL: ordena a lista das tarefas baseado na capacidade de execu{\c c}{\~a}o para evitar que o drone seja alocado em tarefas de baixo desempenho ou import{\^a}ncia. A lista de tarefas {\'e} ordenada pelos UAV com base nas capacidades e tend{\^e}ncias.

4) LAL: Aperfei{\c c}oa o SAL com um limitador de sele{\c c}{\~a}o de tarefas para evitar que um drone selecione muitas tarefas e gere um estado de idle em outro (sem tarefas). Para cada rodada do token, cada drone s{\'o} pode selecionar uma quantidade limitada de tarefas de modo que seja permitido que outro drone tamb{\'e}m possa escolher tarefas (inclusive com capacidade maior que o anterior)

Estrutura da Avalia{\c c}{\~a}o:
- Experimental setup do artigo est{\'a} dentro do Planejamento da Experimenta{\c c}{\~a}o
- Cada cen{\'a}rio da tabela 1 corresponde a um contexto. {\'E} poss{\'\i}vel pois utiliza simula{\c c}{\~a}o.
- O algoritmo {\'e} um fator e ser{\'a} trocado em cada cen{\'a}rio para teste (vari{\'a}vel independente)
- VARIAVEIS DEPENDENTES: total rewards, makes pan, qualidade das tarefas, quantidade das tarefas conclu{\'\i}das, quantidade de mensagens e tempo de execu{\c c}{\~a}o (Se{\c c}{\~a}o 6 do artigo - parte do planejamento do experimento)
- Os valores das vari{\'a}veis independentes s{\~a}o escolhidos aleatoriamente

- O design adotado foi: 1 fator com mais de 2 tratamentos (o fator {\'e} o algoritmo e o tratamento feito foi os 4 tipos Swarm, AL, SAL, LAL) - Muda o algoritmo e executa novamente com o mesmo contexto (cen{\'a}rio) [[The scenarios were run 30 times for each proposed algorithm ]]

@article{MPL-03,
	Abstract = {Context
Complex software-intensive systems comprise many subsystems that are often based on heterogeneous technological platforms and managed by different organizational units. Multi product lines (MPLs) are an emerging area of research addressing variability management for such large-scale or ultra-large-scale systems. Despite the increasing number of publications addressing MPLs the research area is still quite fragmented.
Objective
The aims of this paper are thus to identify, describe, and classify existing approaches supporting MPLs and to increase the understanding of the underlying research issues. Furthermore, the paper aims at defining success-critical capabilities of infrastructures supporting MPLs.
Method
Using a systematic literature review we identify and analyze existing approaches and research issues regarding MPLs. Approaches described in the literature support capabilities needed to define and operate MPLs. We derive capabilities supporting MPLs from the results of the systematic literature review. We validate and refine these capabilities based on a survey among experts from academia and industry.
Results
The paper discusses key research issues in MPLs and presents basic and advanced capabilities supporting MPLs. We also show examples from research approaches that demonstrate how these capabilities can be realized.
Conclusions
We conclude that approaches supporting MPLs need to consider both technical aspects like structuring large models and defining dependencies between product lines as well as organizational aspects such as distributed modeling and product derivation by multiple stakeholders. The identified capabilities can help to build, enhance, and evaluate MPL approaches.},

FOP - Feature Oriented Programming => permits to have the same variability presented by the FM

A dynamic binding unit is a set of static features that can be combined in runtime. We can have more than one binding units in the same DSPL},

	Annote = {Fun{\c c}{\~o}es associadas a C&C
- A meta ou objetivo
- Papeis, responsabilidades e relacionamentos
- Estabelecendo regras e restri{\c c}{\~o}es
- Monitoramento e avalia{\c c}{\~a}o da situa{\c c}{\~a}o e progresso
Novos elementos inseridos:
 -Inspira{\c c}{\~a}o, motiva{\c c}{\~a}o e gera{\c c}{\~a}o de confian{\c c}a
 -Treinamento e educa{\c c}{\~a}o
 -Provisionamento



= Comando e lideran{\c c}a podem estar sendo desempenhados por indiv{\'\i}duos diferentes


A inten{\c c}{\~a}o/objetivo origina-se de uma an{\'a}lise complexa onde v{\'a}rios elementos e inst{\^a}ncias de comando s{\~a}o envolvidas. N{\~a}o {\'e} a decis{\~a}o do comandante. Pode-se ter um cen{\'a}rio onde diversos {\'o}rg{\~a}os ou sistemas participam e influem na escolha dos objetivos.

Importante determinar os papeis aplicando os recursos dispon{\'\i}veis de maneira adequada e colaborativa.
A colabora{\c c}{\~a}o, bem como papeis e responsabilidades n{\~a}o podem ser engessados hierarquicamente ao longo do tempo. Precisa se auto ajustar {\`a}s novas circunst{\^a}ncias e mudan{\c c}as no cen{\'a}rio.

As regras e restri{\c c}{\~o}es que modelam o comportamento dos participantes s{\~a}o fixas e vari{\'a}veis. Devem ser fixas para evitar manifesta{\c c}{\~o}es particulares que destoam dos objetivos comuns.

Monitoramento e avalia{\c c}{\~a}o da situa{\c c}{\~a}o e o progresso das a{\c c}{\~o}es ajudam a fornecer elementos que permitem ajustar as tarefas de C&C. Medir a qualidade de C2 indica como as mudan{\c c}as de circunst{\^a}ncias foram percebidas e respondidas (velocidade e adequabilidade)

Provisionamento para permitir que todos os recursos necess{\'a}rios estejam dispon{\'\i}veis no momento da necessidade, bem como a realoca{\c c}{\~a}o e ajustes no caso de imprevistos.
A aplica{\c c}{\~a}o correta dos recursos existentes tamb{\'e}m define o sucesso da miss{\~a}o.

Power to the Edge -> capacidade de uma organiza{\c c}{\~a}o de sincronizar dinamicamente suas a{\c c}{\~o}es. Alcan{\c c}ando agilidade em C2


Command => Control => Behavior => Effects => Situation Information (It keeps contact with all others phases)

Command and Control as separated functions gives flexibility degree to the system

Command - Estabelecimento e comunica{\c c}{\~a}o do conjunto inicial de condi{\c c}{\~O}es
		-  Avalia{\c c}{\~a}o constante da situa{\c c}{\~a}o
		-  Mudan{\c c}as nas inten{\c c}{\~o}es

Podemos dizer que o Command {\'e} composto de:
- Inten{\c c}{\~a}o
- Aloca{\c c}{\~a}o de pap{\'e}is e responsabilidades
- restri{\c c}{\~o}es
- consci{\^e}ncia situacional
- Aloca{\c c}{\~a}o de recursos

Control  => Determine whether current and/or planned efforts are on track

Behaviors => interactions among individuals and organizations that accomplish the functions associated with C2

Planning => it needs to consider contingencies

(There is no more a single commander )Decision rights spreaded among organization => important to keep communications and sharing information


Tipos de Redes:
-Fully COnnected (eficiente mas lenta; ideal para problemas complexos)
- Random Networks (Probability; baixa efici{\^e}ncia e baixa resili{\^e}ncia)
- Scale-Free Networks (pequeno grupo com alta densidade de intera{\c c}{\~o}es; a maioria dos elementos possuem poucas intera{\c c}{\~o}es; Se aproxima de uma distribui{\c c}{\~a}o exponencial)
- Small World Networks (Mais eficiente; clusteriza{\c c}{\~a}o; a dissemina{\c c}{\~a}o da info ocorre em poucos passos; ``small worlds `` conectados por meio de n{\'o}s)

A Melhor estrutura {\'e} a combina{\c c}{\~a}o:
- Scale-Free no n{\'\i}vel mais alto
- Small-world no n{\'\i}vel intermedi{\'a}rio
- fully connected no n{\'\i}vel local

------------
Information shared => less constraints and better quality and tools to prospect data

---------
Three Keys -> Dimension of C2

1. Allocation of decision rights
2. Patterns of interaction
3. Distribution of information

------------
Power to the Edge:
Mudan{\c c}as no processo de intera{\c c}{\~a}o entre individuos ou grupos 
	- Confere maior autonomia aos ``elementos de borda''
	- reduz constraints desnecess{\'a}rias
	- amplia o acesso {\`a} informa{\c c}{\~a}o

------

Mission Capability Pack (MCP) => Deployable capability
(DOTMLP)

Quality of information position (Data and capability to turn these data into high quality information)

ISR => Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
Informa{\c c}{\~a}o => utilizada para a constru{\c c}{\~a}o do reuso comum individual ou do grupo
Behaviors depends on the individual and team characteristics
Collaboration => working together for a common purpose. (Alberts et al., Understanding Information Age Warfare, pp 185-203)

	Abstract = {The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) defines an SPL as a set of software-intensive systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission. A fundamental principle of SPLs is variability management, which involves separating the product line into three parts - common components, parts common to some but not all products, and individual products with their own specific requirements - and managing these throughout development. Using SPLs seeks to maximize reusable variation and eliminate wasteful generic development of components used only once. Although traditional SPL engineering recognizes that variation points are bound at different stages of development, and possibly also at runtime, it typically binds variation points before delivery of the software. In contrast, DSPL engineers typically aren't concerned with pre-runtime variation points. However, they recognize that in practice mixed approaches might be viable, where some variation points related to the environment's static properties are bound before runtime and others related to the dynamic properties are bound at runtime.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Information systems of the future will have to perform well within ever-changing organizational environments. Unfortunately, existing software development methodologies (object-oriented, structured or otherwise) have traditionally been inspired by programming concepts, not organizational ones, leading to a semantic gap between the software system and its operational environment. To reduce this gap, we propose a software development methodology named Tropos which is founded on concepts used to model early requirements. Our proposal adopts the i∗ organizational modeling framework, which offers the notions of actor, goal and (actor) dependency, and uses these as a foundation to model early and late requirements, architectural and detailed design. The paper outlines Tropos phases through an e-business example, and sketches a formal language which underlies the methodology and is intended to support formal analysis. The methodology seems to complement well proposals for agent-oriented programming platforms.},

- Aplica{\c c}{\~o}es desenvolvidas como DSPL, adicionando/removendo features em tempo de execu{\c c}{\~a}o
- Em SPL, para cada configura{\c c}{\~a}o do sistema temos uma nova medi{\c c}{\~a}o da confiabilidade (dependability) independente
- EM DSPL, al{\'e}m dessa an{\'a}lise, {\'e} necess{\'a}rio verificar os diferentes  contextos, identificando se ao menos uma configura{\c c}{\~a}o gerada pelo DSPL atende aos requisitos de confiabilidade.

=> Mudan{\c c}as no contexto e nos objetivos: impactos na DSPL

-maintainability: o sistema consegue refletir as mudan{\c c}as no contexto

- Reconfigura{\c c}{\~a}o do sistema em tempo muito curto (30ms) - DSPL

=> SPL: conjunto de softwares que compartilham um conjunto comum e gerenciado de features e que satisfazem a um conjunto de necessidades espec{\'\i}fico.
	- gerenciamento da variabilidade
	- Domain Model (descreve features), Feature Model e CK(Configuration Knowledge)


=> DSPL: permite a varia{\c c}{\~a}o do software em tempo de execu{\c c}{\~a}o atendendo {\`a}s novas necessidades do usu{\'a}rio e/ou do contexto
	- arquitetura: MAPE-K (Monitoring detectando eventos, Analysis avaliando os impactos das mudan{\c c}as no sistema, Planning as adapta{\c c}{\~o}es necess{\'a}rias, Execution o planejamento de adapta{\c c}{\~a}o and Knowledge para repetir e manter esse loop de opera{\c c}{\~o}es)
	- Foco em DSPL orientada a objetivos (goal-oriented)

=> Sistema exemplo (BSN-DSPL) Body Sensor Network
	- Uma rede de sensores que capturam sinais vitais de um indiv{\'\i}duo e envia para um sistema central analisar, podendo identificar situa{\c c}{\~o}es cr{\'\i}ticas de sa{\'u}de.
	- Caso a sa{\'u}de esteja boa, alguns sensores podem ser desligados (economia de energia)
	- Sistema orientado a Quality Goal
	
Requisitos:
=> Reliability: a reconfigura{\c c}{\~a}o feita pelo DSPL deve atender os requisitos do quality goal com confiabilidade

=> Maintainability: Com os diferentes n{\'\i}veis corporais dos indiv{\'\i}duos, o sistema precisa ter bom n{\'\i}vel de manutenabilidade para adequar-se aos novos padr{\~o}es

Analisar a confiabilidade em SPL
=> Nr grande de produtos de software
=> variability-aware (conhecimento da variabilidade) que permite reaproveitar esfor{\c c}os de an{\'a}lises em diversos produtos de software

=> Os produtos de sofwtare seguem uma cadeia de markov (modelo estoc{\'a}stico atrav{\'e}s de valores discretos que dependem apenas do estado atual)

---------

Domain Engineering => ocorre estaticamente em tempo de desenvolvimento
Application Engineering => ocorre dinamicamente em tempo de execu{\c c}{\~a}o para adaptar-se {\`a}s mudan{\c c}as de contexto e objetivos esperados.

Feature=> caracter{\'\i}stica distingu{\'\i}vel e relevante em um sistema para o stakeholder

Feature Modeling=> construct a domain model mapping all features and variability. Normalmente uma {\'a}rvore listando as features e como elas se relacionam e interdependem e se relacionam. Associam aos requisitos funcionais e n{\~a}o-funcionais. (Aten{\c c}{\~a}o para depend{\^e}ncias entre features)


DSL Specification => Conhecimento do contexto aprimorado ou mudan{\c c}as no contexto provocam altera{\c c}{\~o}es no n{\'\i}vel de confiabilidade do produto
DSPL orientado a objetivos (stakeholders needs and expectations)
As transi{\c c}{\~o}es entre estados precisam ser completas (evitar travamentos)


Architecture Design => permite o comportamento din{\^a}mico do DSPL

Mapeamento entre uma dada confiabilidade desejada (como objetivo) e a configura{\c c}{\~a}o que atende a esses requisitos.
=> Al{\'e}m de atender ao n{\'\i}vel de confiabilidade desejado, {\'e} necess{\'a}rio atender {\`a}s constraints do modelo de features (Feature Model). Isso {\'e} poss{\'\i}vel atrav{\'e}s das regras de reescrita do Feature Model.
=> Chamado de Constraint Satisfaction Problem. (CSP)

	Abstract = {The original formulation of SharedPlans by B. Grosz and C. Sidner (1990) was developed to provide a model of collaborative planning in which it was not necessary for one agent to have intentions-to toward an act of a different agent. Unlike other contemporaneous approaches (J.R. Searle, 1990), this formulation provided for two agents to coordinate their activities without introducing any notion of irreducible joint intentions. However, it only treated activities that directly decomposed into single-agent actions, did not address the need for agents to commit to their joint activity, and did not adequately deal with agents having only partial knowledge of the way in which to perform an action. This paper provides a revised and expanded version of SharedPlans that addresses these shortcomings. It also reformulates Pollack's (1990) definition of individual plans to handle cases in which a single agent has only partial knowledge; this reformulation meshes with the definition of SharedPlans. The new definitions also allow for contracting out certain actions. The formalization that results has the features required by Bratman's (1992) account of shared cooperative activity and is more general than alternative accounts (H. Levesque et al., 1990; E. Sonenberg et al., 1992).},

-Awareness-dial: this adjust the level of awareness and helps with the way that the team orginizes itself.

* global awareness => the group is aware that for all action, there is a pair of agents (i,j) where agent i is aware about j intention
* detailed awareness => for all actions in the plan, there is a pair of agents (i,j), such that the group is aware that  the agent i is committed to agent j to fullfill the action alfa

The different degrees of awareness is characterized in terms of different types of beliefs.

Dial: a manner to adjust the level of awareness (collective awareness)

The awareness dial will define the collective commitment level
   - negotiating and persuading one another who will do what.


Strongest type of group commitment: (1)robust collective Commitment
								
(2) Strong collective commitment (the group as a whole believes that things are under control)

(3) Weak collective commitment: there is no collective awareness about the plan correctness; the group does not know the plan details but still beleive that the thing are under control


Team commintment: the awareness-dial is putted in a way that the collective intention ensures that the team structure exists and the overall goal and composition of the team are commonly believed

The most simple structure is done by: one initiator element controls the team

Topologies:
1 - Robust Commitment + Single Initiator + Full Communication
2- Star Topology + Single Initiator + Restricted Communication
3- Ring topology + Single initiator (similar to swarm gap strategy - base article)
4- Hierarchical group (tree)




===========

TeamWork


Awareness => observation, communication or reasoning
(Beliefs about itself, about the others and about the environment

Levels of awareness: intra-personal (itself), inter-personal(others) and group awareness


BDI => Beliefs; Desires; Intentions

Symbols:
P => set of Propositional symbols
A => set Agents

L => set of Formulas
			to all proposition p in P is a formula
			if phi and psi are formulas, than we have not phi as well as phi & psi are formulas
			
E-BEL => general believes of a group
C-BEL => common  believes of a group

BEL(i, phi) => agent i believes that phi

Kripke model (M) => set of worlds, set of accessibility relations between worlds and a valuation of the propositional atoms, as follows.
M=(W,{Bi:i in A}, Val)

A team is a group in which the agents are restricted to having a common goal of some sort. Typically, team members cooperate and assist each other in achieving their common goal.  (Weiss)

Intention: set of goals that the agent has the focus on
INT(i, phi) - agent i has the intention to achieve phi
GOAL(i, phi) - agent i has the goal to achieve phi


In TeamLog the teams are created based on the collective intention
intentions are different from beliefs and desires

Cooperative Groups definition (cooperation from game theory)

To avoid the competition, all members have to have the individual intention of others 
M-INTg(Phi) => the group g has the Mutual Intention to achieve phi

Group awareness is the common belief C-BELg of the Mutual Intention
C-BELg(M-INTg(phi))

===> common knowledge <> common belief because CK can be justified

 With no communication, C-BEL does not hold and the C-INT neither.
